VOICE GUARDIAN ALEXA SKILL - TESTING GUIDE FOR SCOTT MEYERS
=============================================================

Hi Scott!

Thank you for helping test the Voice Guardian Alexa skill. This guide will walk you through testing the voice authentication feature.

WHAT YOU'LL BE TESTING
-----------------------
Voice Guardian is an Alexa skill that uses voice challenges to securely trigger home automation scenes. You'll test the authentication flow in TEST MODE (no actual home automation - just verifying the voice challenge system works).


PREREQUISITES
-------------
1. You should have received an email invitation from Amazon Alexa Developer Console
2. Accept the invitation and create/login to your Amazon Developer account
3. Verify the skill endpoint is configured correctly:
   - Go to Build → Endpoint in Developer Console
   - Default Region should be: https://voiceorchestrator.homeadapt.us/alexa/v2
   - SSL Certificate: "My development endpoint is a sub-domain..."
   - Click "Save Endpoints"
4. Build the interaction model (Build → Build Model button)
5. The skill "Voice Guardian" should now appear in your Alexa app under "Skills > Your Skills > Dev"


TESTING STEPS
-------------

STEP 1: Enable the Skill
-------------------------
1. Open the Alexa app on your phone
2. Go to: More > Skills & Games > Your Skills > Dev
3. Find "Voice Guardian" (invocation name: "voice guardian")
4. Click "Enable to Use"
5. Grant any requested permissions


STEP 2: Test Voice Interaction
-------------------------------
Now you'll test the complete voice authentication flow:

🗣️ Say: "Alexa, open voice guardian"
   ✓ Expected: "Home security activated. Say night scene to trigger the scene."

🗣️ Say: "night scene"
   ✓ Expected: "Security check. Please say: [RANDOM PHRASE]"
   ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Listen carefully to the phrase Alexa gives you!

🗣️ Say: [THE EXACT PHRASE ALEXA JUST TOLD YOU]
   Example: If Alexa said "ocean four", you say "ocean four"
   ✓ Expected: "Voice verified. Test mode, scene night scene triggered successfully."


WHAT'S HAPPENING BEHIND THE SCENES
-----------------------------------
When you first try to use the skill:
1. Your Alexa User ID is automatically captured by the system
2. Karthi will receive a notification
3. Karthi will map your Alexa account to your test home
4. After mapping, the voice authentication will work correctly

On your FIRST attempt, you might get: "Your Alexa account is not linked to a home. Please contact support."

This is EXPECTED! Just let Karthi know you tried it, and he'll complete the mapping. Then try again.


TESTING SCENARIOS TO TRY
-------------------------

✅ SCENARIO 1: Successful Authentication
- Say the challenge phrase correctly
- Should hear "Voice verified"

✅ SCENARIO 2: Wrong Challenge Response
- Say the wrong phrase or random words
- Should hear "Voice authentication failed"

✅ SCENARIO 3: Multiple Attempts
- Try triggering "night scene" multiple times
- Each time should give you a DIFFERENT random challenge phrase


WHAT TO REPORT BACK
--------------------
Please let Karthi know:

1. ✓ Did the skill enable successfully in your Alexa app?
2. ✓ What happened on your first attempt? (Expected: "not linked" message)
3. ✓ After Karthi mapped your account, did authentication work?
4. ✓ Was the voice challenge clear and easy to understand?
5. ✓ Did saying the wrong phrase correctly fail authentication?
6. ✓ Any issues or unexpected behavior?


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

Problem: "This skill is not supported"
Solution: Check Developer Console → Build → Endpoint
- Should be: https://voiceorchestrator.homeadapt.us/alexa/v2
- Click "Save Endpoints" and rebuild the model

Problem: "Sorry, there was an error"
Solution: Wait 30 seconds and try again. The skill might still be initializing.

Problem: "Your Alexa account is not linked to a home"
Solution: This is normal on first use. Contact Karthi to complete the mapping.

Problem: Alexa doesn't understand your challenge response
Solution: Speak clearly and at normal pace. Try again with the same phrase.

Problem: "Challenge has expired"
Solution: You waited too long. Say "night scene" again to get a fresh challenge.


VOICE COMMANDS REFERENCE
-------------------------
Wake word: "Alexa, open voice guardian"
Trigger scene: "night scene"
Challenge response: [Say exactly what Alexa tells you]
Help: "help"
Stop: "stop" or "cancel"


TECHNICAL DETAILS (Optional)
-----------------------------
- Skill uses 2-word random phrases from a phonetically distinct wordlist
- Challenges expire after 60 seconds
- Voice authentication uses Alexa's speech recognition
- Test mode bypasses Home Assistant integration
- Unique Alexa User ID: Captured automatically on first use
